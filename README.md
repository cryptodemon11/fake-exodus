# Overview
The Exodus Fake Balance Project lets you create a convincing imitation of the Exodus Wallet interface. You can adjust the displayed wallet address, simulate transactions, and set custom balances, all while keeping the authentic look of the original wallet.

# Key Features

Realistic Interface – The wallet’s appearance remains unchanged apart from the simulated data.

Custom Balances – Instantly set or modify the displayed amount.

Editable Address – Replace the wallet address with any address of your choice.

Fake Transactions – Generate entirely fabricated transactions in just a few clicks.

# How It Works

Download the RAR package.

Extract it to your computer.

Make sure Exodus is closed.

Run Exodus (Python must be installed).

Usage Shortcuts

CTRL + X – Change wallet address information.

CTRL + A – Adjust balance (enter the new amount). Press again to modify.
